/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
The assignment was for the program to take in instructions and print out a Pythagorean tree.
The instructions were the size of the base square and the number of times you want the recursion to occur.


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
One of the key components of the assignment was using ConvexShape in order to draw the square.
We gave it 4 coordinates to draw the square and we stored it in a vector.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/
The pTree recursively called itself to draw the squares.
It will keep calling itself until the depth runs out.
It also uses trig to calculate the squares positions.


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain what you learned in the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
I learned to critically think about recursive algorithm. Recursion has always been little tricky for me
and this assignment really helped me get more comfortable with it.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.
 *  If you didn't complete any part of any assignment,
 *  the things that you didn't do, or didn't get working.
 **********************************************************************/
I had a hard time with the recursion part. I really struggled with it in the beginning.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
 **********************************************************************/
I added color to the squares as well.
